# DD2418-Language-Engineering

This repository will record down what I have learnt and implemented as an exchange student taking the Masters level course DD2418 Language Engineering in KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The course covers theory, methods and application areas.

**Theory:**
The history and basics of language technology, morphology, syntax, and semantics, vector space models, evaluation methods, the principles and methods of terminology work, machine learning, information theory and Markov models, algorithms and data structures for efficient lexicon handling.

**Methods:**
Morphological analysis, generation and language statistics and corpus processing, parsing, generation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, probabilistic parsing and statistical lexical semantics.

**Application areas:**
Spelling- and grammar checking, information retrieval, word prediction for intelligent text entry, text clustering and text categorization, computer assisted language learning, dialogue systems, text summarization, speech technology, localization and internationalization
